      <h2>Bubble Chart: Fines vs Road Deaths</h2>

      <p>
        This chart illustrates the relationship between the total number of fines issued per jurisdiction and road deaths. The bubble size represents the number of fines per 10,000 licensed drivers in each jurisdiction, providing a normalised view of enforcement intensity relative to the driving population.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Insights from the Bubble Chart</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>NSW: High Fines per Driver and High Road Deaths:</strong> NSW (New South Wales) stands out with the largest bubble, indicating the highest number of fines per 10,000 licenses. It also has a high number of road deaths, suggesting both strict enforcement and a significant road safety challenge.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>QLD and VIC: Many Road Deaths, Moderate Fines per Driver:</strong> Queensland (QLD) and Victoria (VIC) have high numbers of road deaths, but their bubble sizes are smaller than NSW, meaning they issue fewer fines per 10,000 licenses. This could indicate less strict enforcement or different driver behavior.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Other States and Territories: Low Fines per Driver and Fewer Road Deaths:</strong> ACT, NT, SA, TAS, and WA have much smaller bubbles, reflecting both fewer road deaths and a lower rate of fines per 10,000 licenses. These regions may have smaller populations, less enforcement, or different reporting practices.
